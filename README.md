### Background Story 
Long long ago, this world has been controlled by a cruel devil. However, a group of warriors came here and defeated this devil to free the people on this land. The devil has been keeping developing his power to try to come back one day. Now, the devil is back, and warriors are leading to fight to protect the land.
### Basic 
We have designed eleven elements towers in total. They are, crystal tower, infernal tower(namely fire element), shadow tower, 
### Gameplay explanation
You will need to build your element towers to defeat the enemy waves and protect home. There are totally three Gates from the wall that enemy broke, and they will flood in through three routes. Fortunately, the Enemy will only start their attack during Night time. So, arm yourself and build the element towers during Day time.

There are a total of 11 different element towers with 5 different rarity.Their rarity will be changing along with the game progress and waves. With two identical towers in your deck and one on the field, you can consume the 2 identical towers in your deck and upgrade the tower on the field. Max level of each tower is Lv. 3.

You can also re-collect the towers on the field into your deck and even sell them to the store. Every time you have extra money, you can refresh the store to get another 5 new towers and buy them to arm yourself up.

There will be totally 10 waves, with the last wave being the Boss Battle. Build your front so that you can defeat the Boss and save the people behind the wall!
