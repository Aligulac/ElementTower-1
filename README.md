We want to combine Classic Strategy Game Tower Defence and AutoChess with some interseting gambling system like drawing cards from a card pool.
## Game Mechnism
### Economy system

We reward players coins by elimanating enemies, and players can utilze those coins to buy more towers and upgrade them. But the probiliy of drawing cards depands on their rarity. Rare cards will have lower probiliy.

### Combinaion between different towers
Like Combinaion in AutoChess, we also have insane effect when certain towers exists on the stages.
